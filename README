KILLER | README

OVERVIEW
Killer is a 3D beat-'em-up game for the Pandora.  This is currently in the
prototype phase, the work here will be evolving constantly.  Please report any
undocumented bugs for the Pandora only.  Linux builds are for emulating the
Pandora by using the PowerVR SDK libraries.  Do not expect this to run on Linux
without a gamepad supporting two analogue sticks, a directional pad, and nine
buttons.

Build instructions will follow later.
